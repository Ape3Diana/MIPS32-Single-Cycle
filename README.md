# Implementation of a Single-Cycle MIPS32 Processor

This project involves implementing a **MIPS32 single-cycle processor** supporting:

- **8 R-type instructions**
- **6 I-type instructions**
- **1 J-type instruction**

## Features

- Full **control signals** required for correct operation
- **Step-by-step program trace** demonstrating the processorâ€™s functionality

## Example Program

- Computes the **Fibonacci sequence** up to a number `n` stored in memory
- Stores the Fibonacci numbers multiplied by 8 back into memory
